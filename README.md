Leaphly Sandbox
================

## Help, re-tweet and stay tuned.

We have worked a lot in order to provide this shopping cart.

We have tried to get things decoupled, in order to have a better maintenance and flexibility.

We have used some design patterns, that allow you to give value to the specific domain of your company and products.

There is a lot to do: [@leaphly](http://twitter.com/leaphly).
